---

### Flutter ML Services (3 files)

#### 5. **lib/ml/ensemble_predictor.dart** (~350 lines)
**Purpose:** Ensemble voting system for 3 models

**Features:**
- Loads Transformer (50%), LSTM (30%), Random Forest (20%) TFLite models
- Weighted voting: Combines predictions with configured weights
- Fallback: Rule-based RF if TFLite model missing
- Input validation: Ensures [120, 42] shape
- Output: `EnsemblePrediction` with label, confidence, probabilities

**Usage:**
```dart
final predictor = EnsemblePredictor();
await predictor.loadModels();

final prediction = await predictor.predict(features);
// Output: BUY (78.5% confidence)

if (prediction.isTradeable) {
  await executeTrade(...);
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces overfitting (ensemble > single model)
- Leverages strengths of different architectures
- More robust than any individual model

---

#### 6. **lib/ml/adaptive_calibrator.dart** (~400 lines)
**Purpose:** Dynamic confidence calibration based on recent performance

**Features:**
- Temperature scaling: Adjusts prediction sharpness
- Rolling window: Tracks last 100 predictions
- Expected Calibration Error (ECE) calculation
- Per-class accuracy tracking
- Auto-adjusts minimum confidence threshold

**How it works:**
1. Model predicts 90% confidence → Only correct 60% of time
2. Calibrator detects overconfidence (ECE = 0.30)
3. Increases temperature (1.0 → 1.4) → Softens probabilities
4. New calibrated confidence: 70% (more realistic)

**Usage:**
```dart
final calibrator = AdaptiveCalibrator();
final calibrated = calibrator.calibrate(rawPrediction);

await calibrator.recordOutcome(
  prediction: calibrated,
  actualPrice: 50000.0,
  futurePrice: 51200.0,
);

// After 100+ predictions:
// Temperature auto-adjusts (e.g., 1.0 → 1.3)
// Min confidence auto-adjusts (e.g., 60% → 65%)
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents overconfident predictions → Reduces losses
- Adapts to changing market conditions
- Improves expected value of trades

---

#### 7. **lib/ml/model_manager.dart** (~500 lines)
**Purpose:** Safe model deployment with A/B testing (Champion/Challenger)

**Features:**
- Shadow mode deployment (0% traffic initially)
- Gradual traffic ramp-up (0% → 10% → 50% → 100%)
- Automatic performance monitoring (accuracy, Sharpe ratio)
- Auto-promotion if challenger outperforms (> 5% better accuracy, > 0.2 Sharpe)
- Auto-rollback if challenger underperforms (> 10% worse accuracy)

**Workflow:**
1. Deploy new model as challenger (shadow mode, 0% traffic)
2. Monitor for 7 days alongside champion
3. If challenger better: Traffic increases to 10%, then 50%, then 100%
4. After 30 days of success: Promote to champion
5. If challenger worse: Automatic rollback to champion

**Usage:**
```dart
final modelManager = ModelManager();
await modelManager.initialize(); // Loads champion

// Deploy new model
await modelManager.deployChallenger();

// Get prediction (auto-routes to champion/challenger)
final prediction = await modelManager.predict(features);

// Record outcome
await modelManager.recordOutcome(
  prediction: prediction,
  actualPrice: currentPrice,
  futurePrice: futurePrice,
);

// Auto-evaluation happens after each outcome
// Traffic adjusts automatically based on performance
```

**Benefits:**
- Zero-downtime model updates
- Data-driven promotion decisions
- Automatic rollback prevents production disasters
- Continuous improvement without risk

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Training data collection takes > 6 hours**
A: Normal if collecting 2+ years of data. Use `--limit` parameter to test with smaller dataset first.

**Q: Model accuracy < 50% (worse than random)**
A: Check for data quality issues (NaN/Inf), class imbalance, or insufficient data. Aim for 10,000+ samples.

**Q: TFLite model > 5 MB**
A: Enable quantization: `converter.target_spec.supported_types = [tf.float16]`

**Q: Inference too slow (> 500ms)**
A: Enable GPU delegate on Android: `InterpreterOptions()..useNnApiForAndroid = true`

**Q: Ensemble predictor loading fails**
A: Check that `.tflite` files exist in `assets/ml/`. Run `flutter pub get` and rebuild.
