        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: October 25, 2025</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>TL;DR:</strong> MyTradeMate does NOT collect, store, or share ANY of your personal data. Everything stays on your device. Your privacy is our priority.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            MyTradeMate ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application ("App") handles your data.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Our core principle: We don't collect your data. Period.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal information.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Specifically, we do NOT collect:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)</li>
            <li>Financial information (credit cards, bank accounts)</li>
            <li>Location data</li>
            <li>Device identifiers</li>
            <li>Usage analytics or tracking data</li>
            <li>Cookies or similar tracking technologies</li>
            <li>Your Binance API keys or credentials</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Local Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
            All data generated by the App is stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>API Keys:</strong> Stored encrypted on your device using FlutterSecureStorage (AES-256 encryption)</li>
            <li><strong>Trading History:</strong> Stored locally in app database on your device</li>
            <li><strong>Portfolio Data:</strong> Stored locally, fetched directly from Binance API</li>
            <li><strong>Settings & Preferences:</strong> Stored locally on your device</li>
            <li><strong>AI Predictions:</strong> Calculated locally using on-device ML models</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> If you uninstall the App, all this data is permanently deleted from your device. We have no backups because we never received your data in the first place.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            The App connects to third-party services that have their own privacy policies:
        </p>

        <h3>4.1 Binance API</h3>
        <p>
            When you provide your Binance API key, the App communicates <strong>directly</strong> with Binance servers to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fetch your portfolio data</li>
            <li>Execute trades (if you enable TRADING permissions)</li>
            <li>Retrieve market data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>We do NOT act as an intermediary.</strong> Your device talks directly to Binance. Your API keys never leave your device.
        </p>
        <p>
            Binance's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/privacy" target="_blank">https://www.binance.com/en/privacy</a>
        </p>

        <h3>4.2 No Analytics or Tracking</h3>
        <p>
            We do NOT use:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Analytics</li>
            <li>Firebase Analytics</li>
            <li>Crashlytics</li>
            <li>Any tracking or advertising SDKs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            While we don't collect your data, we take security seriously for data stored on your device:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> API keys are encrypted using AES-256 via FlutterSecureStorage</li>
            <li><strong>Biometric Authentication:</strong> Optional Face ID/Touch ID/Fingerprint protection</li>
            <li><strong>HTTPS Only:</strong> All communications with Binance use encrypted HTTPS connections</li>
            <li><strong>No Server Storage:</strong> We don't have servers storing your data because we never receive it</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
            Since we don't collect your data, there's nothing for us to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide (we don't have your data)</li>
            <li>Correct (we don't store your data)</li>
            <li>Delete (we never received your data)</li>
            <li>Port (there's nothing to export from our end)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All your data is on <strong>your device</strong>, under <strong>your control</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Our App is not intended for use by children under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect data from children.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Age Requirement:</strong> You must be 18+ to use MyTradeMate, as cryptocurrency trading is restricted to adults in most jurisdictions.
        </p>

        <h2>8. International Users</h2>
        <p>
            Since all data is stored locally on your device and we don't operate servers, there are no international data transfers to worry about.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Posting the new Privacy Policy in the App</li>
            <li>Updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Legal Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Trading Risk:</strong> Cryptocurrency trading involves substantial risk of loss. MyTradeMate provides tools and information but does NOT provide financial advice. Always do your own research and only invest what you can afford to lose.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>No Guarantees:</strong> AI predictions are not guarantees of future performance. Past performance does not indicate future results.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Summary:</strong> Your data stays on your device. We don't collect, store, or share anything. Your privacy is guaranteed by design, not by promise.
