# 🚀 QUICK START GUIDE - Post-Fix Actions

**All critical fixes have been completed!** Here's what you need to do next:

---

## ✅ STEP 1: Generate Android Keystore (Required - 5 minutes)

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/upload-keystore.jks \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
  -alias upload
```

**You'll be prompted for:**
- Password (choose a STRONG one and save it!)
- Your name and organization details
- Confirm with "yes"

---

## ✅ STEP 2: Create key.properties File (2 minutes)

Create `android/key.properties` with:

```properties
storePassword=YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
keyAlias=upload
storeFile=/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/upload-keystore.jks
```

Replace:
- `YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` - password you just created
- `YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD` - same as keystore password (or different if you chose one)
- `YOUR_USERNAME` - run `whoami` to find it

---

## ✅ STEP 3: Test Build (5 minutes)

```bash
# Clean previous builds
flutter clean

# Build release AAB
flutter build appbundle --release

# Should output: ✓ Built build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

**If successful:** You're ready to upload to Google Play! 🎉

**If error:** Check `RELEASE_SIGNING_GUIDE.md` for troubleshooting.

---

## ✅ STEP 4: Test App Startup (2 minutes)

```bash
flutter run --release
```

**Expected:** App should start in <1 second (previously 8-15 seconds).

You should see in console:
```
🔄 BACKGROUND: Starting ML model loading...
✅ BACKGROUND: globalPredictor initialized
✅ BACKGROUND: CryptoMLService initialized - All 18+ models loaded!
```

---

## ✅ STEP 5: Test Order Validation (Optional - 3 minutes)

1. Run app
2. Go to Orders tab
3. Enter any quantity (e.g., 0.123456789 BTC)
4. Submit order (paper trading mode)

**Expected:** Quantity automatically rounded to correct decimals.

Console should show:
```
✅ Quantity validation: 0.123456789 → 0.12346 (stepSize: 0.00001)
```
